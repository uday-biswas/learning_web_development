          helloWe have been playing cricket we have 
          applying well. Some good stuff in the rained 
          off games too. 
          We knew that 20 overs would 
          constitute a match, but we could see the 
          weather coming. Has been following us. this is getting too
          dramatic for bcci as they are failing to fix the perfect match venue. 
          Daryl has been hanging out for a bowl for 
          ages. Milne felt a niggle but didn't want to
          n writing this book, I was guided by my long-standing experience and interest in teaching
    discrete mathematics. For the student, my purpose was to present material in a precise,
    readable manner, with the concepts and techniques of discrete mathematics clearly presented
    and demonstrated. My goal was to show the relevance and practicality of discrete mathematics
    to students, who are often skeptical. I wanted to give students studying computer science all of
    the mathematical foundations they need for their future studies. I wanted to give mathematics
    students an understanding of important mathematical concepts together with a sense of why
    these concepts are important for applications. And most importantly, I wanted to accomplish
    these goals without watering down the material.
    <h1 class="cursiving ">2. why discrete mathematics</h1>
    For the instructor, my purpose was to design a flexible, comprehensive teaching tool using
    proven pedagogical techniques in mathematics. I wanted to provide instructors with a package
    of materials that they could use to teach discrete mathematics effectively and efficiently in the
    most appropriate manner for their particular set of students. I hope that I have achieved these
