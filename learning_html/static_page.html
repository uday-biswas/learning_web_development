    <p id="para1"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <u><b>sub para started</b></u> We have <abbr style="text-decoration: none;" title="aur bhai kaisa h">ABKH</abbr> been playing cricket we have 
    applying well. Some good stuff in the rained 
    off games too. 
    We knew that 20 overs would 
    constitute a match, but we could see the 
    weather coming. Has been following us. this is getting too
    dramatic for bcci as they are failing to fix the perfect match venue. </p>

    <h4 class="cursiving ">1. about the book</h4>
    n writing this book, I was guided by my long-standing experience and interest in teaching
    iscrete mathematics. For the student, my purpose was to present material in a precise,
    readable manner, with the concepts and techniques of discrete mathematics clearly presented
    and demonstrated. My goal was to show the relevance and practicality of discrete mathematics
    to students, who are often skeptical. I wanted to give students studying computer science all of.</div>
    <div><b><u>sub div 2 started</u></b>the mathematical foundations they need for their future studies. I wanted to give mathematics
    students an understanding of important mathematical concepts together with a sense of why
    these concepts are important for applications. And most importantly, I wanted to accomplish
    these goals without watering down the material.
    <h4 class="cursiving ">2. why discrete mathematics</h4>
    For the instructor, my purpose was to design a flexible, comprehensive teaching tool using
    proven pedagogical techniques in mathematics. I wanted to provide instructors with a package
    of materials that they could use to teach discrete mathematics effectively and efficiently in the
    most appropriate manner for their particular set of students. I hope that I have achieved these
    goals.
    <h4 class="cursiving ">3. acknowledgement</h4>
    &nbsp;I have been extremely gratified by the tremendous success of this text. The many improvements in the seventh edition have been made possible by the feedback and suggestions of a large
    number of instructors and students at many of the more than 600 North American schools, and
    at any many universities in parts of the world, where this book has been successfully used.
    This text is designed for a one- or two-term introductory discrete mathematics course taken
    by students in a wide variety of majors, including mathematics, computer science, and engineering. College algebra is the only explicit prerequisite, although a certain degree of mathematical
    maturity is needed to study discrete mathematics in a meaningful way. This book has been designed to meet the needs of almost all types of introductory discrete mathematics courses. It is
    highly flexible and extremely comprehensive. The book is designed not only to be a successful
    textbook, but also to serve as valuable resource students can consult throughout their studies
    and professional life.</div></div>
