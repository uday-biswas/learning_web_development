html important points-

basic structure of html:
   ● <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that the file being displayed is HTML5 page. 
   ● <html> </html> meant to contain all the html data and is the start of an HTML document. 
   ● <head> </head> provides information about the document. 
        It is not displayed in the browser window. 
   ● <title> </title> provides a title for the document. 
         it is written between head tags.
   ● <body> </body> contains all the things visible on the web page.
=>The tag name can either start from an alphabet or an underscore(_).
=> Attributes can provide additional information about the HTML elements 
     on your page and control their behaviour. 
   Eg: <tag_name attribute_name="value"> Content Enclosed </tag_name>
=>HTML tags are not case sensitive, <p> means the same as <P>.
=>there are 6 heading tags from <h1> to <h6> , the size and boldness of the text 
inside the header tags will go on decreasing as we go from h1 to h6.
=>we can use this header tags multiple times in a single html file.

=>html,head,title,body,h1 etc are paired tags and if opened , then they needed
to be closed . example : <title> ind vs newzealand </title>.
and there are many single tags too that dont need to be closed.
example : <br> 
=><br> tag is used to add a line breaker.
=> A new paragraph is written inside <p> and </p>
=> $nbsp is used to add spaces.
=> we represent the unordered lists by listing them inside <li> and </li>
   and all the <li> tags are written inside <ul> and </ul> tags.
   the name of the "type" attribute can be circle , disc , square.
=> attributes are used to add extra information to the tags.
   example: <ul type="cirle"> 
                <li> mahendra singh dhoni </li>
                <li> virat kohli </li>
            </ul>
=>we represent the ordered lists by listing them inside <li> and </li>
   and all the <li> tags are written inside <ol> and </ol> tags.
  >the values of the "type" attribute can be a(alphabets),A,i(roman numericals),I,1(numbers).
  >the values of the "start" attribute can be number. 
          example: <ol type="A" start="5">  starts the list from 5.
=> <img> is single tag used to add image
   >the value of the attribute "src" is the file name of the image.
         the image file should be present in the same folder as the html file
         otherwise the absolute path of the image file should be given.
   >the value of the attibute "alt" is the alternative text ,that would be 
         shown only if the image does not loads.
   >there are two attributes "height" and "width" to specify the size of the picture.
     example: <img src="peakpx.jpg" 
                   height="300"
                   width="100%"
                   alt="macOs background">
=> we represent the hyperlinks by the text by placing the text inside the anchor tag <a> and </a>.
   >the value of the attribute "href" is the link that the text will refer to.
   >the value of the attribute "target" is "_blank" to open the link website 
     into a new tab.
=> By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
      ● An unvisited link is underlined and blue
      ● A visited link is underlined and purple
      ● An active link is underlined and red
   example: <a href="https://frontendfoc.us/" target="_blank"> frontend focus </a>
   >we can even make the image as hyperlink by inserting the image inside anchor tag.
      example: <a href="https://frontendfoc.us/" target="_blank"> 
                  <img src="peakpx.jpg" 
                      height="300"
                      width="100%"
                      alt="macOs background">
               </a>
   >even we can link it to any other html file within the computer by giving 
    the absolute or relative path.
      example: <a href="intro.html" target="_blank"> frontend focus </a>
=>The <div> tag defines a block-level section or a division and the item inside
   <div> and </div> are used for common css style.
  by default ,the browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element.
=> internal links <=
  firstly , we will give unique IDs to the tags and then will give the unique id as the
  value to the attribute "href" of <a> tag to refer to that tag. 
  we have to use # before the ID .
  if we use only # as value of href, then it will refer to the top of the page.
  example, <a href="#para7"> go to the para 7 </a>
           .
           .
          <p id="para7"> this is the para number 7 </p>

=>BLOCK VS INLINE ELEMENTS
 =>Block elements are those that take up the full width available on a web page, 
   effectively blocking out any other elements from sitting next to it on the left or right. 
 =>Inline elements are those who only take up as much width as much needed to display the
   contents of the element, thereby allowing other elements to be in line with the inline element. 
   Block elements always start on a new line. Inline elements does not start from a new line. 
   Examples of block elements are <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <nav>, etc. 
   Examples of inline elements are <b>, <i>, <span>, <img>, etc. 
   NOTE: You can also check which elements are block and which are inline by inspecting them using chrome

=> <i> - defines italic text. eg. <i> written in italics </i>
=> <sub> is used for subscripts
=> <sup> is used for superscripts
=> <del> is used for deleted text by striking through the text
=> <mark> is used for highlighting the text
=> <q> places the text inside the quotes
=> <tt> makes the text looks like as it is by a typewritter

=> special characters
An HTML entity is a piece of text that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a
semicolon(;) and between is the hex code or entity name. These entities are used to display
the reserved characters. Eg., these are some html entities with how they will look on browser:
● some useful character entities - &nbsp;(single space), &lt;(<), &gt;(>), &apos;('), &copy;(©)
● mathematical symbols - &forall; , &sum;
● some other entities - &larr;(←), &hearts;(♥), &trade;(™)

=> tables
  all the data inside the table are written between <table> tags.
  <tr> is used for representing rows
  <td> is used for representing data inside the cell
  <th> inplace of <td> if the data to be represented in bold 
  =>The border attribute is used for mentioning the thickness of the borders. If you do
    not specify a border attribute the table will be displayed without any borders.
  =>The <caption> tag defines a table heading. 
    The <caption> tag must be inserted immediately after the <table> tag.
  =>Attribute rowspan is used to mention the number of rows that a particular cell will
    be occupying. Attribute colspan is used to mention the number of columns that a
    particular cell will be occupying. They both are used with the td tag and can also be
  example:
        <table id="table2" border="4">
        <caption><b><u>table 2</u></b></caption>
        <tr><td></td><th colspan="2">row1</th><th>row2</th></tr>
        <tr><th rowspan="2">col1</th><td>cell(1,1)</td><td>cell(1,2)</td><td>cell(1,3)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>cell(2,1)</td><td>cell(2,2)</td><td>cell(2,3)</td></tr>
        <tr><th>col2</th><td>cell(3,1)</td><td>cell(3,2)</td><td>cell(3,3)</td></tr>
        </table>
